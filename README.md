## Statistical Inference
### Introduction
As a commodity to be consumed, the quality of wine is of great importance, though it can differ greatly from wine to wine. A possible factor that influences the quality of a wine is its composition, so this study will aim to use statistical inference to determine if there is a significant difference between the compositions of different quality wines.

The dataset used is the Wine Quality dataset from the UCI machine learning repository, and it consists of red and white variants of vinho verde wine. For this study, we will only be using red wine and we will classify each wine as either "low" or "high" quality.

Wine quality is linked to what is referred to as the sugar-acid balance, so understanding how the acidity of a wine affects its quality is of significant importance (White, 2019). Therefore, the variables of interest are:

Fixed Acidity: A major wine constituent, contributing greatly to its taste, imparting the sourness or tartness that is a fundamental feature in wine taste.

Volatile Acidity: The steam distillable acids present in wine, primarily acetic acid but also lactic, formic, butyric, and propionic acids, imparting a vinegar-like taste.

And the research question being answered in this study is:

Do fixed acidity and volatile acidity differ between different qualities of red wine?
