## Statistical Inference
### Introduction
As a commodity to be consumed, the quality of wine is of great importance, though it can differ greatly from wine to wine. A possible factor that influences the quality of a wine is its composition, so this study will aim to use statistical inference to determine if there is a significant difference between the compositions of different quality wines.
